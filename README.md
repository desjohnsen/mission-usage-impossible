# Mission: Usage Impossible
A deliberately frustrating mobile app built with React Native, Expo, and Firebase Authentication.   
Created as a school assignment to explore bad UX intentionally. The app blends UI, mini-games, and playful interactions inspired by retro games like Snake and Flappy Bird to deliver a chaotic, nostalgic, and intentionally annoying user experience.

## Features
- User registration and login via Firebase Authentication
- Onboarding flow that intentionally confuses and frustrates
- Multiple screens: landing page, profile page, and a "chaos" page with deliberately irritating UI elements and mini-games
- Retro-inspired, nostalgic design and playful animations
- Full functionality, with all flows working despite intentionally poor UX

## Tech Stack
- React Native
- Expo
- Firebase Authentication
- TypeScript 

## Notes
This was a collaborative school project developed with a teammate.  
- My teammate handled backend and authentication logic  
- I focused on UI, front-end interactions, and game functionality
